# Evapotranspiration Project
Repository for my Master thesis project on estimation evapotranspiration through energy balance models and creating a Random Forest Classifier.

In the folder 'GEE scripts' you can find the scripts which work within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) javascript web editor. If you want a link to my complete repository in GEE, please send me a message.

All additional python scripts will also be added to this repository. 

# Manual
I will add a manual here on how to produce your own results using the implemented S-SEBI model.
